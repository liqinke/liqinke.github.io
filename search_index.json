My research interests lie in the fields of electronic structure methods and magnetism, with a current focus on 2D materials, magnetic topological materials, and other quantum materials. Recent research interests: Develop and apply Ab initio dynamic spin susceptibility to describe magnetic interactions and spin excitations arXiv:2007.14518 (2020). Develop a highly efficient Green’s-function-based ab initio framework to analyze spin exchange and two-ion magnetocrystalline anisotropy Phys. Rev. B 99, 054418 (2019). Besides numerical methods, I also enjoy analytical modeling, especially modeling of spin-orbit-coupling physics Phys. Rev.
