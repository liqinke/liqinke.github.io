To accelerate the design and optimization for desirable electronic and magnetic properties, we aim to develop cutting-edge, highly-efficient computational methods to predict and control such properties in these quantum materials. This project permits complex designs to be quickly tested for timely guidance to experiment for validation, and, in turn, also provides direct verification of the theoretical results. This project will focus on magnetic van der Waals layered materials, which are ideal platforms for 2D magnetism. Beyond accelerating the discovery of novel magnetic materials, this project will also advance our fundamental understanding of quantum effects in nanostructures for the design of transformative technologies. 2022 (Liu et al. 2022; Lee et al. 2022) 2021 (Ke and Katsnelson 2021; Lee et al. 2021; Mkhitaryan and Ke 2021; Gordon et al. 2021) 2020 (Lee, Kotani, and Ke 2020) 2019 (Ke 2019; Ji et al. 2019) Publications "],["magnetic-topological-materials.html", "1.2 Magnetic topological materials", " 1.2 Magnetic topological materials (Li et al. 2020; Timmons et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2020) Publications "],["skyrmions-and-chiral-magnetism.html", "1.3 Skyrmions and Chiral magnetism", " 1.3 Skyrmions and Chiral magnetism Figure 1.1: Skyrmions are a type of quasiparticle with properties that could lead to the next generation of data storage and transfer. Ames Laboratory recently gained great insight into these structures, but scientists are still trying to understand the dynamics of their formation. Ames Laboratory recently discovered a never-before-seen characteristic of skyrmions, which can divide like biological cells. The insight could lead to better control and manipulation of skyrmions, which could help guide the design for high density and energy efficient data storage and transfer devices.

We calculate bare and full dynamic spin susceptibilities to describe magnetic interactions and spin excitations in various materials. This method is useful for investating the magnetic interactions and excitations in itinerant systems, since the Stoner excitations and spinwave excitations are treated on equal footing. Tight-binding code is developed to investigate the detailed band structures and magnetic properties such as magnetocrystalline anisotropy. We start from the realistic TB model constructed using wannier90 or non-orthogonal basis and construct Hamiltonain and Green’s functions. Some of the functions are listed below: Bandstructure Band structures projected on the surface BZ. Movie Fermi surface Green’s functions (GF) Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) Perturbation theory treatment of SOC using GF Spinwave theory, linear or nonlinear, is used in our research to compare with inelastic neutron scattering measurements or estimate Curie temperatures of 2D materials. One of the latter examples is our using of renormalized spin wave theory on magnetic 2D van der Waals materials. We also use to investigate the disorder effects on spin excitatiosn. Micromagnetics is used to investigate extrinsic magnetic properties in permanent magnets or combined with string method to investigate the growth mechanism of magnetic skyrmions.

MAE contributions from throughout the Brillouin zone are obtained using magnetic force theorem calculations with and without perturbation theory. The results from both methods agree with each other, and both reflect features of the Fermi surface. The intrasublattice and intersublattice contributions to MAE are evaluated using a Green’s function method. We find that the sign of the intersublattice contribution varies among compounds, and that its amplitude may be significant, suggesting MAE can not be resolved accurately in a single-ion manner. The results are further validated by scaling spin-orbit-coupling strength in density functional theory. Overall, this realistic tight-binding method provides an effective approach to evaluate and analyze MAE while retaining the accuracy of corresponding first-principles methods.

V. Mkhitaryan and Liqin Ke PRB 104, 064435 (2021) Abstract We develop a self-consistently renormalized spin-wave theory, within a mean-field approximation, for the two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet with perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice, as well as its few-layer and bulk extensions. In this method, the magnetization dependence on temperature is found as the solution of the self-consistency equation. Furthermore, we account for the physical difference of surface and bulk layers by treating the layers as separate sublattices. Thus the method can be readily generalized to study various magnetic phenomena in a broad range of systems, including those comprising magnetically inequivalent sublattices. Using our theory, we calculate the temperature-dependent magnetization for two chromium-based layered van der Waals insulating magnets, Cr\\(_2\\)Ge\\(_2\\)Te\\(_6\\) and CrI\\(_3\\), employing various sets of Heisenberg exchange and single-ion anisotropy values reported for these materials in the existing literature. As expected, we observe a strong dimensionality effect where the ordering temperature is reduced and its sensitivity on the anisotropy is enhanced with the decrease of dimensionality.
