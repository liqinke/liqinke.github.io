We calculate bare and full dynamic spin susceptibilities to describe magnetic interactions and spin excitations in various materials. This method is useful for investigating the magnetic interactions and excitations in itinerant systems since the Stoner excitations and spin-wave excitations are treated on equal footing. Tight-binding code is developed to investigate the detailed band structures and magnetic properties such as exchange coupling and magnetocrystalline anisotropy.

Here we assume the response is stationary and system posseses translational symmetry. Within RPA, the full susceptibilities are calculated using \\(\\chi=\\chi_0 + \\chi_0 I \\chi\\). Within time-dependent LDA, the exchange correlation kernel can be explicitly calculated using \\(I_{\\rm xc}^{+-}={B_{\\rm xc}({\\bf r})}/{m}({\\bf r})\\) for a collinear spin structure. In general, we represent two-particle quantities \\(\\chi^{0}\\), \\(\\chi\\) and \\(I\\) using a mixed basis~ \\(\\{B_{i}({\\bf r})\\}\\), which consists of the product basis~ within the augmentation spheres and interstitial plane waves. The product basis itself is constructed by the products of wavefunctions and their energy derivatives within the augmentation spheres. Since magnetic moment and response are nearly completely confined within the magnetic Cr sites, we further project \\(\\chi( \\mathbf{q},\\omega )\\) onto the functions \\(\\{m_i({\\bf r})/||m_i||\\}\\) representing normalized local spin densities on each magnetic site, which gives a matrix \\(\\chi _{ij}( \\mathbf{q},\\omega )\\) in magnetic basis site indices~. This projection corresponds to the rigid spin approximation (RSA), which is a modest approximation for magnetic semiconductors such as \\(\\text{CrI}_3\\). The sum rule~ used can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{M({\\bf r}_1)}{\\omega} = \\int_\\Omega \\,\\mathrm{d}{\\bf r}_2\\ \\chi^{+-} ({\\bf r}_1,{\\bf r}_2,{\\bf q}=0,\\omega), \\label{eqsumm} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\Omega\\) denotes the unit-cell volume. Within RSA, reduce to two equations for each \\(\\omega\\). We further assume that kernel \\(I(\\omega)\\) is site-diagonal and \\({\\bf q}\\)-independent, allowing it to be determined solely by . Note that ensures the Goldstone magnon mode at \\({\\bf q}=0\\) and \\(\\omega=0\\).

Self-consistently renormalized spin-wave theory We develop a self-consistently renormalized spin-wave theory, within a mean-field approximation, for the two-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnet with perpendicular easy-axis anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice, as well as its few-layer and bulk extensions. In this method, the magnetization dependence on temperature is found as the solution of the self-consistency equation. Furthermore, we account for the physical difference of surface and bulk layers by treating the layers as separate sublattices. Thus the method can be readily generalized to study various magnetic phenomena in a broad range of systems, including those comprising magnetically inequivalent sublattices. Using our theory, we calculate the temperature-dependent magnetization for two chromium-based layered van der Waals insulating magnets, Cr\\(_2\\)Ge\\(_2\\)Te\\(_6\\) and CrI\\(_3\\), employing various sets of Heisenberg exchange and single-ion anisotropy values reported for these materials in the existing literature.
